# Splunk Whisperer 2 (Python)
## Usage
I created two files to reduce dependencies (no HTTP server) when building the LPE executable file.

* Local Privilege Escalation (LPE): you have a shell on the computer, then use `PySplunkWhisperer2_local.py`. The following arguments exist but are optional:
    * `--scheme`, default="https"
    * `--port`, default=8089
    * `--username`, default="admin"
    * `--password`, default="changeme"
    * `--payload`, default="calc.exe", you must adapt for Linux targets
    * `--payload-file`, default="pwn.bat", you must adapt for Linux targets
    The app bundle is created locally (temp file) and Splunk installs it from there.


* Remote Code Execution (RCE): the Universal Forwarder is exposed, then use `PySplunkWhisperer2_remote.py`. The following arguments exist. They are all optional, except `--host` and `--lhost`:
    * `--scheme`, default="https"
    * `--host`, **required=True**, this is your target
    * `--port`, default=8089
    * `--lhost`, **required=True**, this is your own IP
    * `--lport`, default=8181
    * `--username`, default="admin"
    * `--password`, default="changeme" (**note**: this default password does not work remotely by default)
    * `--payload`, default="calc.exe", you must adapt for Linux targets
    * `--payload-file`, default="pwn.bat", you must adapt for Linux targets
    The app bundle is created on your computer (temp file) and Splunk fetches it through HTTP (hence the need for `--lhost`).

## Supported platforms
The current code targets Universal Forwarders running on Windows by default. If you want to target Linux, change the payload with `--payload` and the payload filename with `--payload-file`.

* You can build an executable file for `PySplunkWhisperer2_local.py` with PyInstaller, see `build_exe.bat`, so you can run it on any Windows computer without having Python installed.
* `PySplunkWhisperer2_remote.py` runs on Windows and Linux

### Credits
This tool is inspired by [the original Splunk Whisperer](https://github.com/airman604/splunk_whisperer) by @airman604.

The main advantage of this version is that the Deployment Server used by the Universal Forwarder is not changed. It only installs a new application (then removes it) so it is less intrusive and the code is simpler.
