# SplunkWhisperer2
## Description
Local privilege escalation, or remote code execution, through Splunk Universal Forwarder (UF) misconfigurations.
See https://clement.notin.org/blog/2019/02/25/Splunk-Universal-Forwarder-Hijacking-2-SplunkWhisperer2/ for more details.

## Which one to use?
* You have a local shell on a Windows computer running Splunk UF?
    * If .NET 4.5, or later, is available (or you don't know), use `SharpSplunkWhisperer2`
    * Otherwise, use `PySplunkWhisperer2_local`
* You can contact remotely the Splunk UF API (HTTPS port 8089 by default) and you have the credentials (**note**: the default credentials are *admin/changeme* but they do not work remotely by default)?
    * Use `PySplunkWhisperer2_remote`

`PySplunkWhisperer2` works fine on Linux targets too (adapt the payload file name and content accordingly).

Note also that `SharpSplunkWhisperer2` relies on the [Splunk SDK for C#](http://dev.splunk.com/csharp) library, whereas `PySplunkWhisperer2` directly calls the [Splunk REST API](http://dev.splunk.com/restapi).

### Credits
These tools are inspired by [the original Splunk Whisperer](https://github.com/airman604/splunk_whisperer) by @airman604.

The main advantage of these versions is that the Deployment Server used by the UF is not changed. It only installs a new application (then removes it) so it is less intrusive and the code is simpler.
