# Splunk Whisperer 2 (C#)
## Prerequisites
This tool requires at least .NET 4.5 (which isn't available by default on Windows 7 / 2008). If this condition is not met, see `PySplunkWhisperer2` in the same repository.

## Build instructions
I do not publish binaries on purpose. You have to build it yourself, for example with Visual Studio 2017 Community. The required packages are fetched by NuGet.

## Usage
`SharpSplunkWhisperer2` only implements Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) mode for Windows targets. For Remote Code Execution (RCE),  and Linux targets, see `PySplunkWhisperer2` in the same repository.

The following arguments exist but are optional:
* `--UserName`, default="admin"
* `--Password`, default="changeme"
* `--Port`, default=8089
* `--Scheme`, default="https"
* `--Payload`, default="calc.exe"

The app bundle is created locally (temp file) and Splunk installs it from there.

## Supported platforms
`SharpSplunkWhisperer2` is designed to be run locally on Windows computers.

### Credits
This tool is inspired by [the original Splunk Whisperer](https://github.com/airman604/splunk_whisperer) by @airman604.

The main advantage of this version is that the Deployment Server used by the Universal Forwarder is not changed. It only installs a new application (then removes it) so it is less intrusive and the code is simpler.
